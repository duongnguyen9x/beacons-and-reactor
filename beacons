In salt minion (minion config):

sudo vim /etc/salt/minion
beacons:
  inotify:
    - { "files": { "/etc/ssh/sshd_config": { "mask" : ["modify"] } } }   #(It can be delete it self on so, it should in this form cause it have error with dict in py file )
    - disable_during_state_run: True

sudo systemctl restart salt-minion
sudo systemctl status salt-minion

Or in pillar in salt master, you can do the same. But you have to take few steps here:
sudo vim /srv/pillar/beacons.sls 
sudo vim /srv/pillar/top.sls
sudo salt '*' state.highstate
sudo salt '*' saltutil.refresh_pillar

And then on salt master, take this command: sudo salt-run state.event pretty=true
At the same time, on salt minion, change file "/etc/ssh/sshd_config"
Om master, it will show an event:
salt/beacon/salt-minion.internal.cloudapp.net/inotify//tmp/services	{
    "_stamp": "2021-06-05T15:02:28.584488",
    "change": "IN_IGNORED",
    "id": "salt-minion.internal.cloudapp.net",
    "path": "/tmp/services"
}
